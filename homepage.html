    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>
      The world wide web exists and functions because of the evolution and development of the HTML language. 
      It is the foundation to everything we see online. HTML is an extremely pivotal part of how we view the 
      internet, it has grown and adapted to meet the needs of new technology and expectations of the new 
      generation of users.
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML stands for hyper text markup language and is the basic standard language for creation of readable 
      web pages on the world wide web. In short, HTML tells the browser how to display messages by labeling 
      different components like “this is a paragraph” or “this is a heading”, it is the basic structure that 
      can be built upon. The language breaks this down by placing what is being posted by using greater and 
      lesser signs, i.e. &lt;body&gt; or &lt;title&gt;. Those bracketed words are called tags, and you can start 
      a paragraph this way. The tag will be &lt;p&gt; (enter paragraph here) &lt;/p&gt; the p stands for paragraph 
      and this is how you would create a paragraph like this on a basic web page.
    </p>

    <p>
      A web browser will take that data and display the content on a web page but instead of seeing bracketed 
      letters you would see the paragraph in between. A web page can be more than just letters and that is 
      where CSS and JavaScript come into play. CSS stands for cascading style sheets and this is where you 
      can bring in color, font and even spacing. JavaScript allows for interaction and behavior in a web page.

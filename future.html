    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>

    <p>
      The world of technology is expanding daily, and with it, the number of people creating and interacting with the web.
      HTML will need to continue evolving to support more powerful tools, faster devices, and higher expectations.
      Only recently has HTML5 become fully adopted, largely because of demands for improved connectivity, better performance,
      more storage options, offline capabilities, and richer integration with other technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      The HTML living standard outlines many possible future enhancements. One example is improved image resizing capabilities,
      allowing images to automatically adapt their pixel size across platforms. Artificial intelligence could also influence HTML’s future;
      AI-assisted code generation may reduce the amount of manual HTML needed for responsive or media-heavy layouts.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is an active group responsible for maintaining and proposing updates to HTML: WHATWG 
      (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group). This community develops new ideas and helps bring them into the official standard.
      As HTML continues evolving, one challenge may be maintaining backward compatibility with older devices that cannot update as quickly.
      Developers will have to balance innovation with accessibility across all user devices.

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>
      HTML was invented in 1991 by physicist Sir Tim Berners-Lee. While created in 1991,
      it was not released until 1993 and not fully published until 1995.
      The earliest version, HTML 1.0, only included 18 tags and was primarily used by a small group of developers.
      With growing interest, HTML 2.0 was released in 1995 and became the standard until 1997.
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML 3.0 attempted to introduce more advanced features such as tables and improved formatting,
      but technology at the time was not yet capable of supporting its heavier functionality.
      HTML 4.01, released in 1999, became one of the most widely used versions.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2012, HTML5 was officially introduced. This version brought roughly 140 tags and major improvements,
      including semantic elements and built-in multimedia support—eliminating the need for plugins like Adobe Flash.
      HTML5 also improved compatibility with mobile devices, which became increasingly important as smartphones grew in popularity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, APIs (application programming interfaces) help HTML-powered websites connect with external tools and services.
      Users expect fast-loading pages, good accessibility, mobile responsiveness, and cross-browser reliability.
      Tools such as WCAG, Lighthouse, WebPageTest, REST, and GraphQL support modern development workflows.
    </p>

    <p>
      As of today, 95% of websites use HTML5 and 97.1% use HTML overall.
      HTML remains the most dominant language on the web, with no indication of fading away—
      instead, it continues evolving to support new technologies.

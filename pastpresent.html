    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>
      HTML was invented fairly recently back in 1991 by a physicist named Sir Tim Berners-Lee.
      While it was invented in 1991, it was not released until 1993 and not published until 1995.
      The original version was HTML 1.0, which only consisted of 18 HTML tags.
    </p>

    <p>
      Developers weren’t creating many websites yet, so HTML 2.0 was released in 1995 as the first official specification.
      HTML 3.0 followed, introducing tables, fonts, and more powerful features—but it slowed down browsers at the time.
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML 4.01 arrived in 1999 and quickly became one of the most widely used versions.
      Later, HTML5 was introduced in 2012, adding about 140 tags, multimedia support, and semantic elements.
      HTML5 removed the need for plug-ins like Adobe Flash and made mobile web design vastly more functional.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, modern web pages rely on APIs, browser tools, and accessibility standards such as WCAG.
      Technologies like REST, GraphQL, Lighthouse, and WebPageTest support today's expectations for speed,
      accessibility, and mobile functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
      As of this writing, over 95% of all websites use HTML and nearly all browsers fully support HTML5.
      HTML continues to evolve to meet modern needs.
